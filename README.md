"# Test_Project" 

Hello guys data solution Here!
To make this project work normally you have to clone the repo first in your local machine and then create three java class for homePage and the signInPage 
and the third is a junit test case file so then copy all the code in each file and then you have to import the selenium jarfile in the class path of the project in the build path,  and then all the error must be corrected in the code 
the last step is to put the right link of the msdriver if you are using edge in the signInPageTest class or if you are using another browser you have to install the driver of your browser and thats all .

Hope all things work right inchalah.
